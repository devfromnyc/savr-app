# Welcome to SAVR! A Fullstack Application Powered By React!

SAVR is a fullstack (MERN) REACT application where users can perform full CRUD functions.

The purpose of the app is to track the amount of money saved by NOT purchasing items.

Upon launching the web app, you'll be presented with a homepage with a login and a signup form. Once you've signed up and signed in, you'll be presented with your very own dashboard and pie chart powered by chart.js showing the breakdown (By category) of the money you've saved thus far!

Happy Saving!
